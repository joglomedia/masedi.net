Increase reader retention and reduce bounce rates by displaying a set of related posts on your website or in your feed

== Description ==

<a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/contextual-related-posts/">Contextual Related Posts</a> is a powerful plugin for WordPress that allows you to display a list of related posts on your website and in your feed. 

The list is based on the content of the title and/or content of the posts which makes them more relevant and more likely to be of interest to your readers. This allows you to retain visitors, reduce bounce rates and refresh old entries.

* Output wrapped in CSS classes that allows you to style the list. You can enter your custom CSS styles from within WordPress Admin area
* Customise which HTML tags to use for displaying the output in case you don't prefer the default `list` format

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If your question isn't listed here, please post a comment at the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/contextual-related-posts">WordPress.org support forum</a>. I monitor the forums on an ongoing basis. If you're looking for more advanced support, please see <a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/support/">details here</a>.

= How can I customise the output? =

Several customization options are available via the Settings page in WordPress Admin. You can access this via <strong>Settings &raquo; Related Posts</strong>

The plugin also provides you with a set of CSS classes that allow you to style your posts by adding code to the *style.css* sheet. In a future version, I will be adding in CSS support within the plugins Settings page.

The following CSS classes / IDs are available:

* **crp_related**: ID of the main wrapper `div`. This is only displayed on singular pages, i.e. post, page and attachment

* **crp_related**: Class of the main wrapper `div`. If you are displaying the related posts on non-singular pages, then you should style this

* **crp_title**: Class of the `span` tag for title of the post

* **crp_excerpt**: Class of the `span` tag for excerpt (if included)

* **crp_thumb**: Class of the post thumbnail `img` tag

For more information, please visit http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/contextual-related-posts/

= How does the plugin select thumbnails? =

The plugin selects thumbnails in the following order:

1. Post Thumbnail image: The image that you can set while editing your post in WordPress &raquo; New Post screen

2. Post meta field: This is the meta field value you can use when editing your post. The default is `post-image`

3. First image in the post: The plugin will try to fetch the first image in the post

3. Video Thumbnails: Meta field set by <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/video-thumbnails/">Video Thumbnails</a>

4. Default Thumbnail: If enabled, it will use the default thumbnail that you specify in the Settings screen

The plugin uses <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/">timthumb</a> to generate thumbnails by default. Depending on the configuration of your webhost you might run into certain problems. Please check out <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2010/11/timthumb-hints-tips/">the timthumb troubleshooting page</a> regarding permission settings for the folder and files.

= Manual install =

If you disable automatic display of related posts please add `<?php if(function_exists('echo_ald_crp')) echo_ald_crp(); ?>` to your template file where you want the related posts to be displayed.
You can also use this function to display related posts on any type of page generated by WordPress including homepage and archive pages.

== Wishlist ==

Below are a few features that I plan on implementing in future versions of the plugin. However, there is no fixed time-frame for this and largely depends on how much time I can contribute to development.

* Select random posts if there are no similar posts
* Shortcode support
* Exclude display on select categories and tags
* Restrict related posts to same category
* Better relevance tweaking
* Limit characters in content that is compared
* Improved Custom post support
* Multi-site support
* Ready-made styles
* Upload your own default thumbnail
    

If you would like a feature to be added, or if you already have the code for the feature, you can let me know by <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/contextual-related-posts">posting in this forum</a>.
