As explained in the instructions, storing main post titles with a plugin, as so many SEO plugins encourage you to do, is generally very ill-advised. (Basic SEO best practice: always keep your most direct, engaging and keyword-balanced title as your main post title, stored securely using the standard WordPress method, where it will always be available in this version of WordPress and in all future versions. Display it consistently in both the <code>title</code> tag and in RSS feeds. That is what will show up in dynamically generated links such as SERPs and on other sites which syndicate your content. Place expanded, rephrased or otherwise modified titles -- <em>especially if they rely on the presence of a plugin</em> -- in the body of the post or page.)"
