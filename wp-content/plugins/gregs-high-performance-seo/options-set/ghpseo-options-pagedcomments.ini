preface[] = "The paged comment feature introduced in WordPress 2.7 normally repeats the post content on every page of comments, yielding duplicate content on each of those pages. You can remove the post content from comments pages, providing a link back to the post's permalink, while leaving the content of the comments pages themselves available for indexing. (Note: Under WordPress 2.9, you should also set this plugin to disable the flawed <code>rel canonical</code> inserted automatically by WordPress. This setting is available under the 'Head Meta' section.)"

If you construct your own link inside quotation marks using <strong>%post_title%</strong> and <strong>%post_permalink%</strong>, note that the WordPress function <code>wptexturize()</code> -- used to format text with typographical entities like curly quotation marks -- has a bug which sometimes prevents it from properly handling quotation marks surrounding a tag. To overcome this, either use the provided <strong>%post_title_linked%</strong>, or specify your preferred quotation marks using html entities."

By default, the replacement text you have specified above for eliminating paged comment duplicate post content will be inserted late in WordPress's processing of the post content. That means it will replace whatever else might have been added to the content by another plugin, and in most cases that is desirable. However, there may be situations in which you would rather send your replacement text through earlier, and have other plugins modify it rather than the original post content. In that case, you can raise its priority here -- meaning your replacement text will be inserted sooner, and other plugins will be better able to modify it."
