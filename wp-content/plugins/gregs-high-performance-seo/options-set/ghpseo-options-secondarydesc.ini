header[] = "Enabling Secondary (On-Page) Descriptions"
preface[] = "Many blogs use the post excerpt to provide a hand-crafted summary, sometimes actually displaying that summary at the top of the page in addition to the main text of the post itself. Secondary descriptions enhance that functionality by enabling you to specify alternative text which can be used in place of the excerpt when a page or post is viewed, while also providing the functionality of the excerpt for pages, which WordPress itself does not provide. Secondary descriptions may include XHTML tags. You can specify whether to enable secondary descriptions, and also how any default text should be used. By default, secondary descriptions won't be included on the post writing/editing screens, since the excerpt will normally be used instead -- so be sure to visit this plugin's main configuration page if you'd like them to show up. Please see the 'Secondary Descriptions' section of the <em>Instructions</em> page for notes on implementing the <code>ghpseo_output('description')</code> template tag."

When leaving the default secondary description blank, you can also specify whether that blank description should be used, or whether the secondary description should default to a request for the post excerpt instead. Note that if you specify a replacement secondary description under the Paged Comments section, that setting will still apply for paged comments, independently of what you specify here."
