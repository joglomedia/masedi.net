preface[] = "While the contents of the <code>title</code> tag should be kept relatively short, the body of a post or page affords significantly more space and flexibility. Therefore, it can be useful to provide a <em>secondary</em> title for use in the body. You might make it longer and more descriptive, include a subtitle, or just phrase the main title a little differently to emphasize different keywords. (Do take care not to confuse your readers with a secondary title that's wildly different from your main title as displayed in the title bar of their browser!) See the section on legacy SEO plugins on the <em>Instructions</em> page for more on why secondary titles should go <em>in the body</em> -- and not in the <code>title</code> tag, as most other SEO plugins encourage. You can specify a secondary title while writing or editing a post. To disable secondary titles altogether, just uncheck the following box, and the appropriate main title will appear instead. Please see the 'Secondary Titles' section of the <em>Instructions</em> page for notes on implementing the <code>ghpseo_output('secondary_title')</code> template tag."

For these types of pages, you can choose simply to have the main title repeated wherever the secondary title is displayed, or you can specify them here separately, according to page type. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Secondary titles are not intended for use within the WordPress loop except on single posts and pages, where they can be used either within the loop or outside the loop.
