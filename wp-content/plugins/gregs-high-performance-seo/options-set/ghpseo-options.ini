The simple theme updates are explained fully in the instructions and take no more than a couple of minutes to complete. However, if you would rather not add new template tags to your theme files, you can choose instead to enable the lower performance <em>Sledgehammer Mode</em>, in which case this plugin will use the same type of brute force output buffer hacks that other SEO plugins use to circumvent the design limitations of WordPress."
