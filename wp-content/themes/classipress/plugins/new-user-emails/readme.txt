Requires at least: 2.3
Tested up to: 2.7.1

A Plugin to provide an interface for the Wordpress Welcome Email. Allows adding of headers to prevent emails going into spam and changes to the text.

== Description ==

I thought that the Wordpress Welcome Email to both the Admin and the User were very un-user friendly so I wrote this plugin to allow admin members to change the content and headers.

It simply adds a new admin page that has a few options for the welcome email and gives you a list of hooks to use in the text to make the email a little more personal.

Added support for future extensions whereby the admin notification can be turned off or a different admin (or admins, support for multiple recipients) be notified.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `sb_welcome_email_editor.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the admin page it creates at the bottom of the left menu (in 2.7+)
4. Edit the settings as desired and click save.

Once complete, all new user emails will be sent in the new format.
