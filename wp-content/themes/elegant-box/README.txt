== Create a new style ==

1. create a new folder in '/elegantbox/style/' directory, named in English.
2. create and edit global.css file, the style will be applied anytime.
3. create and edit default.css file, it is enabled when people switch to this style.
4. some other files will be created in the new folder, maybe icons, cutsors, posters and flashes.
